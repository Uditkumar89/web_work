The difference from directly calling fs.write() is that under some unusual conditions, fs.write() may write only part of the buffer and will need to be retried to write the remaining data, whereas fs.writeFile() will retry until the data is entirely written (or an error occurs).The implications of this are a common source of confusion. In the file descriptor case, the file is not replaced! The data is not necessarily written to the beginning of the file, and the file's original data may remain before and/or after the newly written data.For example, if fs.writeFile() is called twice in a row, first to write the string 'Hello', then to write the string ', World', the file would contain 'Hello, World', and might contain some of the file's original data (depending on the size of the original file, and the position of the file descriptor). If a file name had been used instead of a descriptor, the file would be guaranteed to contain only ', World'.
